            Welcome to your first Web3 tutorial! If you have never generated a cryptocurrency address or submitted a transaction on-chain but want to try it out, start here.

            This tutorial assumes you're unfamiliar with the cryptography, math, and computer science concepts happening behind the scenes in Web3, so don't be discouraged if you get confused at any point. 
            Don't hesitate to contact me with any questions or issues while you work through this tutorial- it shouldn't take more than an hour or so.
            If you want recommendations for further Web3/DeFi exploration, shoot me a DM on GitHub/Twitter or Instagram (see icons at the bottom of the page) and I will happily assist.

            This tutorial focuses on the industry standards that are ubiquitous and have rich documentation. 
            MetaMask is the most widespread crypto wallet, although other awesome wallets like Coinbase Wallet/Brave Wallet/Rainbow Wallet are available too.
            All of these wallets connect to the blockchain for you and safely handle your private keys, but here I'll focus on MetaMask.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 text-xs mb-4 mr-8 ml-8'>
            Note: I have been asked many times if a Coinbase, Robinhood, Venmo, CashApp, or Paypal account will adequately serve as a crypto wallet. 
            As of writing, these companies/services do NOT offer a native web3 wallet that allow you to interact with the Ethereum or Bitcoin networks. 
            (Coinbase Wallet is a separate app/browser extension than the Coinbase app you use to buy crypto). 
            These services simply allow you to buy and sell the assets for price speculation. Boring!
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            With that out of the way, let's get started. On the home page, click the link titled: "1. Setting up MetaMask" and follow the instructions on downloading and installing the MetaMask browser extension.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center text-xs indent-4 mb-2 mr-8 ml-8'>
            <a className='font-bold'>URGENT:{' '}</a> 
            Never share your seed phrase (12-24 words) or your private key in any way to anybody. Ever.
            Do not enter, copy-paste, or visibly/physically reveal your seed phrase anywhere, unless you are recovering a wallet.
            Do not respond to the "customer support" scammers that litter social media. 
            Your seed/private key controls your money, so store it in a safe place on paper (or metal!)
            Advanced crypto users should always use a hardware wallet like a

              2. Understanding Ethereum Addresses
            </h1>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Your Ethereum address is a long string of hexadecimal digits starting with 0x, which indicates hexadecimal. For example: 0x65b54A4646369D8ad83CB58A5a6b39F22fcd8cEe.
            This long address can be represented by a .eth domain, such as üë¶üèªüë¶üèª.eth - this is called an ENS domain.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            This address is your public-facing account where you can store any tokens, fungible or not, on the network. 
            This includes cryptocurrencies like $ETH, which is the base layer token of the Ethereum blockchain and is responsible for securing the network.
            In addition to security, $ETH maintains the ever-changing state of the global computer known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM for short).
            It's also used to pay for all EVM computation, called transactions, in the form of gas. 
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            We'll cover gas a bit more later, but basically you must pay $ETH for every transaction you make in order to prevent spammers from clogging the network.
            Any transaction changes the global state of the global Ethereum Virtual Machine, with more computation-intensive transactions requiring more gas to execute.
          </p>

              On Alternative L1 Blockchains
            </h1>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            MetaMask, in combination with these skills & concepts, is transferable between any EVM-compatible blockchain. 
            The term 'EVM-compatible' refers to blockchains that are modeled after Ethereum's implementation.
            Among others, these include: 
          </p>
          <div className='flex justify-center mt-4 mb-4'>
            <ol className='list-disc'>
              <li>BSC/BNB</li> 
              <li>Polkadot</li> 
              <li>Avalanche</li>
              <li>Fantom</li> 
              <li>Ethereum classic</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Although those blockchains can be interacted with by using the software and skills taught in this tutorial, they have each made certain tradeoffs in at least one of the three points in the Scalability Trilemma.
            The Scalability Trilemma refers to the balance between the three most important aspects of a blockchain: decentralization, speed, and fees.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            This tutorial focuses on Ethereum and its layer 2 rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Starkware) because they are home to by far the largest and safest Web3 ecosystem.
            Other L1 blockchains that advertise extremely low fees or fast speeds have invariably made a tradeoff in one of the other trilemma categories.
            You may encounter cheap fees and fast block times, but as a result of lowered decentralization your risk of being "rugpulled" or scammed are significantly higher.
            Mess around with the other aforementioned crypto networks at your own risk.
          </p>


  #### Generate An Ethereum Address
  Okay enough talk, we get it- tokens are cool! Follow the MetaMask instructions for setting up your own secure Ethereum address.

  When you've finished, you should see your account in your MetaMask as follows:

  ![MetaMask Account Image](./assets/metamask-account.png)

  You'll notice a 0 $ETH balance and no other token balances displayed yet. Before moving on to the fun stuff, we'll need to switch to Ethereum's cheapest layer 2 network, the Polygon ecosystem.

  #### Understanding Ethereum Layer 2s
  We've covered that Ethereum is a blockchain that permanently stores code and functions as a global computer housing all sorts of programs mostly comprising of various tokens. But transacting on Ethereum's mainnet is very expensive as it prioritizes decentralization, security, and immutability above all else; foregoing speed and cheap transaction/gas fees in favor of the former attributes.  This is important as it provides net neutrality (yes, that thing that the Trump administration absolutely destroyed by handing over throttling priveleges and other dystopian controls over the internet to corporations like Verizon/ATT/TMobile/Google. Screw you, Ajit Pai!) But it comes at high cost, making transacting on the Ethereum network very expensive.

  So smart developers had an idea: why not put more blockchains on the Ethereum blockchain?



  Now you're finally ready for the next step, obtaining a (small) amount of crypto to pay for the gas needed to make transactions on the Ethereum network.

  On gas:
  I thought you told me HuskyCoin was free! Why is there a transaction/gas fee?!
  -Gas costs serve two main purposes: 
  1. Preventing spam on the network by incurring costs that disincentivize clogging the network with low-quality transactions.
  2. Paying the miners/validators who maintain the state of the network by solving and finalizing blocks in chronological sequences. These are the maintainers of a distributed blockchain architecture who facilitate every transfer and transaction on the network, and they don't work for free!
