            MetaMask is the most ubiquitous crypto wallet around, although other great wallets like Coinbase Wallet/Brave Wallet/Rainbow Wallet are available too.
            Each of these wallets connect to the blockchain for you and safely handle your private keys, but here I'll focus on MetaMask since it has the richest documentation.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 text-xs mb-4 mr-8 ml-8'>
            Note: I have been asked many times if a Coinbase, Robinhood, Venmo, CashApp, or Paypal account will adequately serve as a crypto wallet. 
            As of writing, these companies/services do NOT offer a native web3 wallet. 
            (Coinbase Wallet is a separate app/browser extension than the Coinbase app you use to buy crypto). 
            These services simply allow you to buy and sell the assets for price speculation. Boring!

            With that out of the way, let's get started. 
            On the HuskyCoin home page, click the box titled: <a className='font-semibold'>"1. Setting up MetaMask"</a> and follow the external MetaMask instructions on downloading and installing the MetaMask browser extension.

            Once you've successfully installed MetaMask for your browser, open the extension at the top right of the browser and click 
              <a className='font-semibold'> "Create a Wallet"</a> under the 
              <a className='font-semibold'> "New to MetaMask"</a> page. 
            Select whichever data sharing option you wish and set a secure passphrase.
            Unless you are using a hardware wallet, this passphrase will grant access to your funds on this device so be sure to take security seriously.

          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Congratulations on generating your first Ethereum address!
            You can see it at the top of MetaMask, under <a className='font-semibold'>"Account 1"</a>. 
            Your address is a long string of hexadecimal digits starting with 0x, which indicates hexadecimal. 
            For example, my address is: 
          </p>
          <div className='flex justify-center'>
          <a 
            href='https://etherscan.io/address/0x65b54a4646369d8ad83cb58a5a6b39f22fcd8cee' 
            className='text-sm text-center justify-center text-blue-500 mb-2'>{' '}
              0x65b54A4646369D8ad83CB58A5a6b39F22fcd8cEe
          </a>
          </div>
          <p className='indent-8 mb-2'>
            {' '}This long address can be represented by a .eth domain, such as üë¶üèªüë¶üèª.eth - this is called an ENS domain.
            Just like how DNS domains such as google.com and meatspin.com represent IP addresses, ENS domains help make Web3 addresses more human-readable.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            The address displayed on your MetaMask is your public-facing account where you can store any tokens on the network, fungible or not. 
            This includes cryptocurrencies like $ETH, which is the base layer token of the Ethereum blockchain and is responsible for securing the network.
            It can also store any fungible ERC20 tokens such as $UNI, $SHIB, or $LINK as well as any NFTs that you purchase from an NFT marketplace like 
            <a href='https://opensea.io' className='text-blue-500'>{' '}OpenSea.</a>
          </p>
          <div className='flex justify-center'>
            <div className='max-w-2xl mt-8 mb-8'>
              <Image src={MMbalance} layout='intrinsic'></Image>

          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Back on the subject of $ETH, not only does $ETH secure the network but it also is necessary to maintain the ever-changing state of the global computer known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine, called the EVM for short.
            It's used to pay for all EVM computation, what we call transactions, in the form of gas. 
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            We'll cover gas a bit more later, but basically you must pay $ETH for every transaction you make since it changes account balances in the global EVM state.
            Not only does every transaction change the state of the EVM, but more computationally intensive transactions require more gas to execute and are therefore more expensive.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            This fee mechanic may be frustrating and confusing at first, but some form of it must exist on any blockchain in order to deter spammers.
            Think of it this way: if transactions were totally free to change computational state, a disgruntled person would write bots to send an infinite number of spam transactions and crowd out legitimate users submitting their transactions.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            As a result, it can be very expensive to pay gas fees on Ethereum's mainnet during times of high network traffic.
            Even still, it's better than the alternative: a broken blockchain completely clogged by spam.
            Think of how many spam emails you get every day!
            What percentage of all email traffic do you think is spam? 
            <a href='https://securelist.com/spam-and-phishing-in-2021/105713/' className='text-blue-500'>{' '}It's roughly 50% of all emails. Yikes.</a>

          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Not so fast!
            I just got through explaining how annoyingly expensive gas fees are on Ethereum's mainnet!
            You think I'm gonna make you transact on mainnet?!
            No way! 
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Thankfully Ethereum's big-brained core protocol developers have come up with a wild idea to solve these high gas fees:
            why not have even more blockchains settle bundled transaction hashes onto Ethereum blocks?
            I get that you're probably drooling for HuskyCoins right now, but you won't know how to claim them until I teach you how to access these nested blockchains that live on Ethereum.
            You'll get your $HUSKY soon enough, I promise.

              1.b Understanding Ethereum Layer 2s
            </h1>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Separate blockchains that execute computation off of the Ethereum mainnet and then settle their hashed proofs to mainnet are called layer 2 (aka L2) blockchains.
            These layer 2 chains, called rollups, generally make use of either optimistic execution which is checked by fraud proofs or zero-knowledge proofs which is an actively researched field in mathematics.
            The technical details between either L2 rollup type are not important for me to go over here, but definitely worth further reading if you're interested.
          </p>
          <div className='flex justify-center'>
            <div className='max-w-4xl'>
              <Image src={rollups} layout='intrinsic'></Image>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Anyway, these rollup chains run alongside the layer 1 mainnet, handling their own ecosystem of users and smart contracts.
            They essentially lock up tokens like $ETH on mainnet and then only periodically settle hashes called merkle roots from the L2 to the L1, to prove that all funds are accounted for and all transactions are valid.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            It's important for you to understand this concept because the smart contract I've written and deployed for you, HuskyCoin, exists on the 
            <a href='https://polygonscan.com' className='text-blue-500'>{' '}Polygon layer 2 rollup chain.</a>
            {' '}Technically it's a side-chain, but again that's beside the point.
            The point is that the bytecode I wrote and compiled for the HuskyCoin token exists at the following smart contract address on Polygon L2:
            </p>
            <a 
              href='https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8CFb42a80291737Cb62cEF7B665Fe1304D112Fee' 
              className='flex justify-center text-blue-500 text-sm'>
                0x8CFb42a80291737Cb62cEF7B665Fe1304D112Fee
            </a>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2 mt-2'>
            Keep in mind that this smart contract address only exists on the Polygon L2; if you try to find it on mainnet or any of Ethereum's other rollup networks, you won't find it.
            It also exists on Ethereum's Rinkeby testnet at the same address (the following link will take you to Etherscan's Rinkeby block explorer):
          </p>
          <div className='flex justify-center'>

          <p className='indent-8 mt-2'>
            Feel free to interact with it however you like there.

          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Now that you understand rollups, you're finally ready for the next step: configuring MetaMask to connect to the Polygon Layer 2 network.
            To do so, open your MetaMask extension and click the dropdown button labeled with a colored dot and the text "Ethereum Mainnet V".
            Lmeow I used a V since I couldn't figure out how to copy that dropdown arrow next to the word 'Mainnet,' but here's a picture if the V confused you:

            <Image src={networks} layout='intrinsic'></Image>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            It will be located in the top right of your UI.
            This dropdown menu is where you switch between layer 2 networks on the blockchain- you'll note that only the Ethereum Mainnet is available to you at the moment.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8'>
            To add the Polygon L2 mainnet to your MetaMask configuration simply navigate to 
            <a className='text-blue-500'>{' '}https://chainlist.org.{' '}</a>
            This is where you'll find any EVM-compatible network RPC endpoints, including any Ethereum L2 rollups.
            I love using Chainlist because you don't risk mistyping any of the network configuration since it's as easy as clicking a button.
          </p>
          <div className='flex justify-center mt-6 mb-6'>
            <Image src={chainlist} layout='intrinsic'></Image>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8'>
            Scroll down the grid to the block labeled "Polygon Mainnet" and click the button labeled "Connect Wallet."
            Note that you also may need to connect your wallet to the site in the top right first.
            Once you've done so, that button should change to one labeled "Add to Metamask", click it and hit "Approve" and then "Switch network" in the Metamask popup that follows.

              2.a Using $MATIC for gas
            </h1>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Almost there! The last step before you can claim your 69420 HuskyCoins is to obtain a small amount of $MATIC to pay the gas needed to execute any transaction on the Polygon network.
            I know I went on and on about how $ETH is the base-layer token that pays gas on Ethereum, but the Polygon L2 is slightly different because it uses its own custom token to pay gas.
            All the concepts I discussed still apply, the only difference being that $MATIC is the base-layer token on this rollup instead of $ETH.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-4'>
            You'll recall that gas is a mechanic which serves two main purposes:
          </p>
          <ol className='justify-center mb-4'>
            <li className='flex text-center'>
              1. Preventing spam on the network by incurring costs that disincentivize clogging the network.
              </li>
            <li className='flex text-center'>
              2. Paying the miners/validators who maintain the state of the network. 
              These are the backbone of the EVM, so they don't work for free!
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Thankfully gas fees on the Polygon L2 are extraordinarily cheap!
            Each transaction costs a fraction of a cent: roughly 0.004 $MATIC each, which in USD terms is roughly $0.006.
            Much cheaper than the gas fees you'll see on Ethereum Layer 1!

          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Moving on, in order to make your claim your $HUSKY allocation, we first must hit up a faucet to collect a bit of $MATIC.
            Go to:
            <a href='https://polygon-faucet.m00n.city/' className='text-blue-500'>{' '}https://polygon-faucet.m00n.city/{' '}</a>
            and click "Connect Wallet".
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-4'>
            Once you've done so, click the same button now labeled "Get Some MATIC" to be sent a dust amount of $MATIC to pay for your first polygon transaction.

            <Image src={faucet} layout='intrinsic'></Image>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            This faucet only sends you 0.005 $MATIC, which is roughly worth $0.008.
            It's possible that this low amount of funds will not even be enough gas to complete the tutorial, so I've included another faucet link:
            <a href='https://matic.zayd.info/' className='text-blue-500'>{' '}https://matic.zayd.info/</a>.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Come back to this faucet later on in the tutorial if you run into congested network conditions that require more gas to execute your transactions.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2 text-xs mr-8 ml-8'>
            Note: if neither faucet linked has any funds to dispense, or you complete part of the tutorial and don't have enough $MATIC for gas, message me using one of the social media links at the bottom of the page and I'll top up the faucet for you.

          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Head back to the HuskyCoin dApp home page and click on the box marked "3. Claim HuskyCoins from my faucet".
            On the faucet page, click "Receive HuskyCoins" and a MetaMask transaction prompt should appear.

            Feel free to observe the uber cheap $MATIC gas fee and click "Confirm".
            Once the transaction is confirmed by miners, you'll receive a browser notification from MetaMask that looks something like the one below.

            Assuming you successfully claimed your HuskyCoins, you'll notice that your $MATIC token balance went down.
            That's because you spent a tiny amount on gas to the network.

            Sometimes MetaMask doesn't automatically pick up on when you've received or claimed tokens in your wallet.
            In this case, you'll simply need to import them.

              Safety Disclaimer: Alternative L1 Blockchains
            </h1>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Unfortunately, the widespread scams and rugpulls in the DeFi and NFT spaces mean that I have to finish out with a lengthy disclaimer on crypto blockchains other than Bitcoin and Ethereum.
            Basically it boils down to one thing: you're infinitely less likely to get scammed/rugged if you stick to the Ethereum ecosystem.
            BSC and Solana in particular are full of scams that draw you in with cheap fees and fast blocktimes. 
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            That's not to say that it doesn't happen in the Ethereum ecosystem, but it's much less common.
            Not all cryptos are made equal.
            At the end of the day, the more you learn about how these protocols work on a technical level, the safer (and maybe richer ¬Ø\_ („ÉÑ)_/¬Ø ) you'll be.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            MetaMask, in combination with these skills & concepts, is transferable between any EVM-compatible blockchain. 
            The term 'EVM-compatible' refers to blockchains that are modeled after Ethereum's implementation.
            Among others, these include: 
          </p>
          <div className='flex justify-center mt-4 mb-4'>
            <ol className='list-disc'>
              <li>BSC/BNB</li> 
              <li>Polkadot</li> 
              <li>Avalanche</li>
              <li>Fantom</li> 
              <li>Ethereum classic</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            Although those blockchains can be interacted with by using the software and skills taught in this tutorial, they have each made certain tradeoffs in at least one of the three points in the Scalability Trilemma.
            The Scalability Trilemma refers to the balance between the three most important aspects of a blockchain: decentralization, speed, and fees.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            This tutorial focuses on Ethereum and its layer 2 rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Starkware, Polygon) because they are home to by far the largest and safest Web3 ecosystem.
            Other L1 blockchains that advertise extremely low fees or fast speeds have invariably made a tradeoff in one of the other trilemma categories.
          </p>
          <p className='justify-center indent-8 mb-2'>
            You may encounter cheap fees and fast block times, but as a result of lowered decentralization your risk of being "rugpulled" or scammed are significantly higher.
            Mess around with the aforementioned alternative crypto networks at your own risk.
