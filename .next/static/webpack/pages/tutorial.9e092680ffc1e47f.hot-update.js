(Coinbase Wallet is a separate app/browser extension than the Coinbase app you use to buy crypto). They simply allow you to buy and sell the assets for price speculation. Boring! With that out of the way, let's get started. On the home page, click the link titled: \\\"1. Setting up MetaMask\\\" and follow the instructions on downloading and installing the MetaMask browser extension. URGENT NOTE: Never share your seed phrase (12-24 words) or your private key in any way to anybody EVER. Do not enter, copy-paste, or visibly reveal your seed phrase anywhere (especially not to \\\"customer support\\\" scammers) unless you are recovering a wallet. Your seed/private key IS YOUR MONEY, so store it in a safe place on paper (or metal!) #### Understanding Ethereum Addresses Conceptually Note: These skills & concepts are transferable between any EVM compatible blockchain. That means other networks that are modeled after Ethereum's protocol (such as BSC/BNB, Polkadot, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Ethereum classic) can be interacted with by completing these same steps in Metamask. This tutorial focuses on Ethereum and its layer 2 rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Starkware) because they are home to the largest and safest Web3 ecosystem by far. Mess around with the other aforementioned cryptocurrency networks at your own risk. Your Ethereum address (a long string of hexadecimal digits, 0->9 & a->f, which starts with 0x and can be represented by a .eth domain) is your public-facing account where you can store any tokens on the network. This includes cryptos like $ETH, which is the base layer token of the Ethereum blockchain which is responsible for securing the network, maintaining the ever-changing state of the global computer known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM for short), and paying for computations known as transactions in the form of gas. We'll cover gas a bit more later, but basically you must pay $ETH for every transaction you make, with more computation-intensive transactions costing more gas. #### Generate An Ethereum Address Okay enough talk, we get it- tokens are cool! Follow the MetaMask instructions for setting up your own secure Ethereum address. When you've finished, you should see your account in your MetaMask as follows: ![MetaMask Account Image](./assets/metamask-account.png) You'll notice a 0 $ETH balance and no other token balances displayed yet. Before moving on to the fun stuff, we'll need to switch to Ethereum's cheapest layer 2 network, the Polygon ecosystem. #### Understanding Ethereum Layer 2s We've covered that Ethereum is a blockchain that permanently stores code and functions as a global computer housing all sorts of programs mostly comprising of various tokens. But transacting on Ethereum's mainnet is very expensive as it prioritizes decentralization, security, and immutability above all else; foregoing speed and cheap transaction/gas fees in favor of the former attributes.  This is important as it provides net neutrality (yes, that thing that the Trump administration absolutely destroyed by handing over throttling priveleges and other dystopian controls over the internet to corporations like Verizon/ATT/TMobile/Google. Screw you, Ajit Pai!) But it comes at high cost, making transacting on the Ethereum network very expensive. So smart developers had an idea: why not put more blockchains on the Ethereum blockchain? Now you're finally ready for the next step, obtaining a (small) amount of crypto to pay for the gas needed to make transactions on the Ethereum network. On gas: I thought you told me HuskyCoin was free! Why is there a transaction/gas fee?! -Gas costs serve two main purposes: 1. Preventing spam on the network by incurring costs that disincentivize clogging the network with low-quality transactions. 2. Paying the miners/validators who maintain the state of the network by solving and finalizing blocks in chronological sequences. These are the maintainers of a distributed blockchain architecture who facilitate every transfer and transaction on the network, and they don't work for free!\"\n        ]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n        fileName: \"/home/robriks/HuskyCoin/pages/tutorial.js\",\n        lineNumber: 7,\n        columnNumber: 7\n    }, this));\n};\n_c = Tutorial;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Tutorial\");\n\n\n;\n    var _a, _b;\n    // Legacy CSS implementations will `eval` browser code in a Node.js context\n    // to extract CSS.
